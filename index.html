                        Batac City, one of the oldest settlements in Ilocos Norte, traces its beginnings to the late 16th century when it was 
                        established as a pueblo by Spanish missionaries in 1587. Its name, derived from the Ilocano word batac meaning “pull” or 
                        “arrive,” reflects the attraction of early settlers to its fertile lands and abundant resources. During the Spanish period, 
                        Batac became an important agricultural community, producing rice, corn, and tobacco, while also serving as a center for the 
                        spread of Christianity under the Augustinian friars.

                        Under American rule in the early 20th century, Batac saw the establishment of public schools and the strengthening of its local government, 
                        which enhanced the community’s literacy and civic participation. During World War II, the city’s people endured hardships under Japanese 
                        occupation but also contributed to the resistance through local guerilla efforts. This resilience became a defining trait of Batac’s identity 
                        in the modern era.

                        Batac is proudly known as the “Home of Great Leaders,” being the birthplace of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and 
                        General Artemio Ricarte, the “Father of the Philippine Army.” Its cultural pride is further celebrated through food traditions, particularly 
                        the Batac empanada, and historical commemorations. On June 23, 2007, Batac was officially converted into a component city through 
                        Republic Act 9407, marking its transformation from a historic town into a progressive urban center that continues to blend agriculture, 
                        heritage, and modern development.
